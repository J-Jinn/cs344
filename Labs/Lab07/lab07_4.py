Task 1: Examine the Data

Okay, let's look at the data above. We have 9 input features that we can use.

Take a quick skim over the table of values. Everything look okay? See how many issues you can spot. 
Don't worry if you don't have a background in statistics; common sense will get you far.

After you've had a chance to look over the data yourself, 
check the solution for some additional thoughts on how to verify data.

##############################################

Issues I spotted:

rooms_per_person has a minimum of 0, which seems impossible, physically.

rooms_per_person has a maximum of 55.2, which seems way overinflated.

the disparity between min/max for total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, and households seem worrying.

Same in general between the training set and validation set.

Note: I guess I have little common sense and statistical ability (or I didn't drink enough coffee today).

##############################################

Exercise Solution:

Let's check our data against some baseline expectations:

For some values, like median_house_value, we can check to see if these values fall within reasonable ranges 
(keeping in mind this was 1990 data — not today!).

For other values, like latitude and longitude, we can do a quick check to see if these line up with 
expected values from a quick Google search.

If you look closely, you may see some oddities:

median_income is on a scale from about 3 to 15. It's not at all clear what this scale refers to—looks like maybe 
some log scale? It's not documented anywhere; all we can assume is that higher values correspond to higher income.

The maximum median_house_value is 500,001. This looks like an artificial cap of some kind.

Our rooms_per_person feature is generally on a sane scale, with a 75th percentile value of about 2. 
But there are some very large values, like 18 or 55, which may show some amount of corruption in the data.

We'll use these features as given for now. But hopefully these kinds of examples can help to build a little intuition 
about how to check data that comes to you from an unknown source.

"""

###########################################################################################

"""
Task 2: Plot Latitude/Longitude vs. Median House Value

Let's take a close look at two features in particular: latitude and longitude. 
These are geographical coordinates of the city block in question.

This might make a nice visualization — let's plot latitude and longitude, and use color to show the median_house_value.

Wait a second...this should have given us a nice map of the state of California, 
with red showing up in expensive areas like the San Francisco and Los Angeles.

The training set sort of does, compared to a real map, but the validation set clearly doesn't.

Go back up and look at the data from Task 1 again.

Do you see any other differences in the distributions of features or targets between the training and validation data?

##############################################

My Answer:

No, I really don't discern what I should be looking for....

The target values for the training set are generally lower in value than those for the validation set.

The standard deviation for the features are lower in the validation set as compared to the training set.

##############################################

Exercise Solution:

Looking at the tables of summary stats above, it's easy to wonder how anyone would do a useful data check. 
What's the right 75th percentile value for total_rooms per city block?

The key thing to notice is that for any given feature or column, the distribution of values between the train and 
validation splits should be roughly equal.

The fact that this is not the case is a real worry, and shows that we likely have a fault in the way that our train and 
validation split was created.

Task 3: Return to the Data Importing and Pre-Processing Code, and See if You Spot Any Bugs

If you do, go ahead and fix the bug. Don't spend more than a minute or two looking. 
If you can't find the bug, check the solution.

When you've found and fixed the issue, re-run latitude / longitude plotting cell above and confirm 
that our sanity checks look better.

By the way, there's an important lesson here.

Debugging in ML is often data debugging rather than code debugging.

If the data is wrong, even the most advanced ML code can't save things.

##############################################

My solution:

I uncommented the line below that was commented out: (yay, I actually got this one right, so I'm not a complete idiot)

california_housing_dataframe = california_housing_dataframe.reindex(
    np.random.permutation(california_housing_dataframe.index))

##############################################

Exercise Solution:

The code that randomizes the data (np.random.permutation) is commented out, so we're not doing any randomization 
prior to splitting the data.

If we don't randomize the data properly before creating training and validation splits, 
then we may be in trouble if the data is given to us in some sorted order, which appears to be the case here.

Exercise 7.4 Questions:
###########################################################################################

Give a one-paragraph summary of what you learned about using training, validation and testing data-sets.

First, after loading in the data-set into a data-frame, you should always shuffle and randomize the data in order
to avoid any issues pertaining to the given set, such as it being already sorted.

Second, it's a smart decision to at least glance over the raw data using common sense to make sure nothing is
obviously out of place otherwise it's probably not a good idea to use that data.

Third, there is no heuristic algorithm that can be produce in order to auto-tune hyper-parameters as they are
data dependent.

Fourth, use synthetic features to combine individual features in order to deliver more robust performance and
predictions.  This is easier than complexifying the model, changing the data-set, etc.

Fifth, remove or prune outliers in features from consideration as they will negatively affect the performance
and predictions of your model.

Sixth, use mathplotlib to create visualizations of the results in order to better understand what's happening
or identify outliers, etc.

Seventh, training, validation, and test, data sets should be split into their respective sub-sets from the entire
data-set used to train the model.

Eighth, test sets and validation sets "wear" out with repeated use - the more you fit the same data with hyper-
parameter tweaks the less confidence you can be about whether it will fit well when new data is introduced.
Hence, it is smart to collect and use new data to refresh you current test and validation data-sets.

Ninth, the general work flow is:

Train model on training set --> evaluate model on validation set --> tweak model according to results on validation set
--> pick model that does best on validation set --> confirm results on test set.

Tenth, NEVER TRAIN ON THE TEST DATA.

Eleventh, Ockham's Razor in ML terms - "The less complex an ML model, the more likely that a good empirical result
is not just due to the peculiarities of the sample"
    
    -generalization bounds: statistical description of a model's ability to generalize to new data.
